It is favorable if you want to minimize a scan&#39;s size for sharing, but most importantly, to reduce the amount of plastic used in 3D printing. This has two options, “Uniform” and “Geometric”. Uniform simplifies the entire design equally, while Geometric is sensitive to detail, making it perfect for when you want to keep more detailed features. Go ahead and click “Apply”. Play with the ratio until the design is simple enough to your liking, but keep the shape intact. Remember, you can always undo (Ctrl/Command Z) if you don’t like the results.</li></ul><p>If there are random artifacts you want to discard that Isolation isn’t detecting accurately, choose the box select, freehand lasso, or polygonal lasso tool on the right to outline the artifact, and then press delete on your keyboard.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt="Screenshot of pop-up."></p><p>To save the scan, click “File” &gt; “Save.”</p><p><img src="'+_+'" alt="Screenshot of pop-up."></p><p>To export the scan, click the Export button on the top bar.

## Software

Recommended software for designing 3D models:

•  **Tinkercad** (beginner-friendly)

•  **Fusion 360** (advanced CAD software)

•  **Blender** (free and open-source 3D creation suite)

•  Slicing software for preparing models:

•  **Ultimaker Cura** (compatible with most FDM printers)

•  **PrusaSlicer** (specifically for Prusa printers)

•  **PreForm** (for Formlabs printers)


## 3D Printing Process

  

**Designing Your Model**

1. **Choose your design software**: Depending on your skill level, choose software that fits your needs (e.g., Tinkercad for beginners, Fusion 360 for advanced users).

2. **Create or download a model**: Design your model or download one from a repository like Thingiverse.

3. **Save/export your model**: Export your design as an STL.

--------------

**Preparing Your Model**
1. **Open your slicing software**: Use Cura, PrusaSlicer, or PreForm.

2. **Import your model**: Load your STL file into the slicer.

3. **Configure print settings**: Choose the appropriate settings for your print, including layer height, infill density, and support structures.

4. **Generate G-code**: Slice the model to generate the G-code file.

-----------
**Submitting your Print**
1. Once the G-code is generated. Import it into a USB drive.

USB drives for 3D printing can be found in Makerspace.

2. Plug your USB into the printer of your choice.
3. Press the **start** button.

## Guidelines for Use

•  **Print Size**: Ensure your model fits within the build volume of the printer you are using.

•  **Material Usage**: Be mindful of the filament and resin consumption.

•  **Clean Up**: Clean the build plate and surrounding area after your print is complete.

•  **Time Management**: Plan your print ahead of time, considering the estimated print duration.


## Troubleshooting

•  **Print not sticking to the bed**: Ensure the build plate is clean and leveled. Use a suitable adhesive if necessary.

•  **Layer shifting**: Check for loose belts or mechanical obstructions.

•  **Filament jams**: Follow the printer-specific instructions for clearing jams.
